# CSS3 Generator

## Overview

This is generator for CSS3 properties: simply click on a property, enter appropriate 
values and some CSS is generated for your delectation. This project was very much 
inspired by this [CSS3 generator](http://css3generator.com/) in particular.

I'm am using this as an exercise to learn about backbone.js
